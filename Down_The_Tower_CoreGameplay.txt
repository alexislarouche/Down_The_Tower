Core gameplay loop : 
1-Prepare at base for the exploration (buy skills, swap character, prepare skills etc.)
2-Dwelve into the tower and explore (Kill monsters, get loot and solve puzzles)
3-Die (Respawn at base)

Hooks :
-"Fezz puzzle mechanics" (if used well can create simple and fun refreshing puzzles every now and then)
-Various characters = various gameplay style
-Challenging dungeons and bosses

Absolutely needed to work : 
-Well themed art
-Engaging fights
-Nice sounds (minimal music and foremost audio feedback for actions)
-Well balanced mechanics
-Good gameplay feeling (nice feedback, good response time, fluid camera movement on rotation, etc)



-NOTE : for logistics reasons, it would be way easier to rotate/replace the map instead of the camera
